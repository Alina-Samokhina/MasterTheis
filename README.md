Master thesis on bayesian data generation models in multilabel classification of P300 potentials

## Abstract
One of the most popular paradigms for brain-computer interfaces is P300. This thesis covers the multilabel classification task of P300 potentials, induced by the visual stimuli. It is proposed to use a bayesian models for data generation as an augmentation technique. This approach addresses the problem of small imbalanced datasets common in this area by not only augmenting existing data but also by being able to generate new one. In this work there is a comparison of several classifiction algorithms with different augmentations techniques. It is shown that suggested methods allow to obtain more accurate predictions along with quality synthetic data.

## Experiments
For now it's all in the notebook, soon the training and visualizing woild be done through CLI (work in progress)
